        Writing this almost a year into motherhood there are so many things I wish I knew when I was pregnant, so many things I read I wish I listened to, and so many things I could’ve done much better. With that being said, I fully appreciate and am thankful for the process it took to get me to this point as I feel like it’s changed who I am for the best. However, there are some pro tips I felt obligated to share with any other young mothers who are equally as unprepared as I was! 
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%">  
        I got pregnant just before turning 21, something my husband and I wanted more than we were ready for. I read all the articles and blogs I could, and asked family what I needed to know and do to prepare. No amount of advice could make me feel ready though! Not to mention some of my family were not as supportive as one would hope, and with a little mix of bad luck/poor foresight my husband and I’s working situation weren’t as steady as we hoped they would be during such an important time. Long story short we were broke as hell by the time third trimester crept by. Before I get too deep into my story, I want to say pregnancy is a beautiful thing and something that every woman deserves to enjoy, something I myself really enjoyed, but in the end my depression got the best of me for some time and led me not to prepare how I could’ve, and if it weren’t for the help of close family members I don’t know how we would’ve done it!
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%">  
        Skipping ahead to now, it is my goal to help any other broke and depressed moms seeking words of advice to help with their situation. For starters, there were tons of helpful and optimistic articles talking about the excitement of pregnancy and the soon to come motherhood. These articles often (extremely often) included buying things for yourself or doing activities that were far beyond the means of our wallets, so I found myself feeling continuously lost and unsure if I made a mistake bringing a baby into the world when I didn’t know that I’d be able to give him/her the care deserved. A feeling that while no woman should have to feel, is a realistic thought that may have crossed the mind of other people too, so I was surprised on how little I could find to help. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%">  
        Soon I will list some great ways to treat yourself and prepare to nest for your little one in cost effective ways, but first I’ll start with letting you know realistically what birth and motherhood may be like for you. I want so bad to say that it will be a great beautiful change that you’ll go through gracefully, everything will be okay and you’ll be able to handle everything that comes at you because your instincts kick in. Albeit these things are somewhat true, the real truth is the transition to motherhood will rock your world so hard, I don’t say this to scare you or worry you, because in the long run everything really will be okay, you will love your beautiful child and enjoy nurturing them into a great child, but that road is long! So, get ready for the end of every decision you make being for yourself, from now on everything from what you want to do that day, to what you’re wearing, to when you have to go to the bathroom will be on the time of your child. I hope you don’t have to poop anytime soon because your baby just woke up from a nap and he/she is wailing for mom, yes that’s right, you must now prop your baby just outside the bathroom so they can watch you relieve yourself. Sounds super weird, but hearing your baby cry and not being able to do anything about it because you’re stuck on the toilet is truly the worst feeling, I hope you’re avid in singing and pooping because the day will come that you have to do this at least once. Bathroom breaks aside, an average day in the first weeks looks something like: you wake up in the morning to the sound of your baby, you comfort and feed him/her, burp them, you snuggle with them, you let them spend some time in their bassinet or swing if you have either, you quickly grab yourself protein bar because you feel squeamish leaving their side at this time (they’re so tiny it’s insane), you stay by their side and look and talk and coo to them, you don’t really play yet because they don’t see so well until later, not before long they’re hungry again because their tiny tummies can’t hold that much, you put them to sleep for hopefully a few hours (constantly checking to make sure they’re still breathing or putting in a few shhh’s to ease them back to sleep if they fuss), they wake up again for a few hours and you hold them and do things like skin to skin, and they nap again, and soon enough it’s night time, you put them to sleep and feed them back to sleep a few times, to many times throughout the night. It feels pretty basic but when I was pregnant I wanted so bad to know what exactly to expect in a whole day, well ladies this is it for now, your fast paced life of the outside world is behind you for now (excluding those intense screaming diaper changing moments, the times you try to figure out how to help your baby with some apparently extremely uncomfortable gas, and other moments of that nature).
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%"> 
        Now that you have maybe a little better idea of the way things are changing, I can tell you the beginning although the biggest change isn’t necessarily the hardest time. In the early days and weeks of birth is when a baby sleeps the most (up to like 16 hours a day), I was lucky and my baby sometimes slept almost 20 hours a day sometimes. This was great because I still got to have some free time to do things for myself, but not before long, he was awake more and more of the day, then he was rolling over, and then he was crawling, and now he requires constant surveillance since he tries to put everything under the sun in his mouth. I’m trying to make a long story short but it’s getting longer and longer lol, my point is, even if you may be feeling a little depressed for whatever reason or whatever is going on in your life, please try to enjoy this time and try to enjoy all the self care you can right now, because during the next few years you will be thankful for every 5 minutes you can get to yourself. And it’s worth mentioning, my husband and I are so thankful for our son everyday despite the amount of work he is, because he’s our son. When you have yours, the bonding will happen, and your child will teach you real love if you don’t know it already. 
        </p>
        <h3 id="article2">Preparing when you’re expecting</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%">
        Alright so I’m finally here to tell you ways to mentally prepare first because this step although easy to skip, is so important. There are lots of things you can do to keep anxiety or stress down, and take care of yourself in the process, in my opinion practicing self love and self care is one of the best things you can do to get prepared.
        <li>Take warm (not too hot) baths, sprinkle epsom salt or essential oils for your sore muscles, light a few candles, bring some chocolate and a drink and just relax.</li>
        <li>Moisturize your skin, especially your belly. Stretch marks can be hard to fight but not impossible, if having stretch marks scare you make sure to rub cream on them everyday, possibly twice a day in the third trimester.</li>
        <li>Grab your partner and have them massage your feet, if you’re feeling up for it you can massage theirs back at the same time :) If you don’t have a partner, no problem! Try this affordable

        or grab those puppies and give them a good rub with your hands!</li>
        <li>Try meditating, I’m sure you’ve heard this many times but sitting in the proper pose on a pillow, closing your eyes, inhaling and exhaling while thinking “in - - - out” really can be a great way to clear your mind and let your muscles relax, when done right this can even give you a little energy boost.</li>
        <li>Go to the salon or give yourself a pedicure if your belly is still small enough to reach your toes. The nail polish fumes shouldn’t be a problem so far as you’re in a well ventilated area and not huffing them.</li>
        <li>Try a hair mask, right now your hair is probably glowing and thicker than ever, make it smoother than ever too with a cup of mayonnaise for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Try face masks, motherhood can really put your beauty routines on hold, give your skin all the love it deserves in case you don’t have the time you used to later on.</li>
        <li>Spend time exploring things that make you happy, like painting, crafting, cooking, etc. If you plan on being a stay at home mom this is especially helpful as you may be able to turn this hobby into a job later by selling on Etsy.</li>
        <li>Go on walks, it’s so important to stay active and keep your body in top condition in preparation for a healthy birth. Light exercise (if you’ve already been exercising) shouldn’t be a problem for most moms to be either.</li></p>
        
        <p style="text-indent: 10%"> Next we’re going to talk about organizing and nesting. Once that baby is here you won’t get the chance to organize your house again for a while, and having your whole house clean and organized will feel really nice in the weeks to come, especially if you’re not used to spending a lot of time inside. You might be doing well and have a whole room ready for you little one, or you could be like us and still living in a studio apartment. Either way, you want the spaces you’ll be with your baby most often to be clean and have everything you’ll need at easy access. Set up at least wipes, hand sanitizer, blankets, towels, and breast pump supplies (if you plan on using one) near where you’ll be nursing most. I also included some protein bars because if my son fell asleep on my lap in the recliner chair, that was where I planned being until he woke up, which meant that’s also where I napped or ate. And I will note, in the early days after a c section you want to keep from sitting/standing up as frequently as possible as it can be a huge strain on your stomach and your emotional state. Next you want to have an area in your kitchen just for bottle cleaning, if you’re planning on solely breastfeeding that’s great! But I would still suggest at least one bottle incase your supply isn’t enough. And finally the baby’s crib, we had our crib right by the bed with all of the blankets, diapers, and wipes we’d need in it, right above that was an attachment for a bassinet and a changing station. This was so perfect for us because we had so little space and it was only $89, we still use it today almost a year later! Now here’s a list of everything we got by the last trimester, at the time I was afraid it wasn’t enough but it proved to be more than enough until he was a few months older and ready to play with toys.
        <br>***Here I compiled some of the more affordable items on Amazon, so sheltering in place won't stop you from getting everything you need for your baby! Feel free to click the pictures and check them out!***

        </div>
        <li>New car seat -- This is important, most hospitals require you to have one that passes that year’s regulations, I would highly suggest having it installed a month before your due date.</li>
        <div class="pics">
        <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B01F9FLEL4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01F9FLEL4&linkCode=as2&tag=groovyguru03-20&linkId=77c371291255a2eb52923b66acc5f23d"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B01F9FLEL4&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=groovyguru03-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=groovyguru03-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B01F9FLEL4" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />    
        </div>
        <li>Crib -- I couldn't find the exact model I have but this is the same brand and quite similar. If you're really tight on money you can buy one used but I wouldn't suggest that because even if in good condition you may put your young baby at risk of germs and illness. We co-slept with our son but still used the crib in the first week or so because he was so delicate! I would highly suggest a crib but if that's not accessible to you, it's not the most important thing on this list.</li>

        <li>Baby bath -- This is very similar to the bath we used, I loved it for when he was young and tiny, now he takes showers with us and it's one of his favorite activites! The type of bath you want to use is totally up to your preference!</li> 
        <div class="pics">

        </div>
        <li>3-6 blankets for swaddling -- Swaddling is a big part of the early weeks and can really help your little one sleep and stay comfy. It's not as hard as it may seem and there are plenty of online videos that show how you can do it! I suggest closer to 6+ incase of any leaks or spit up, you want to always have a few handy incase the others are dirty! In addition to this I definitely suggest getting some baby rags to sling over your shoulder when you burp your baby because you should expect at least a little spit up most of the time. But of course anything like an old shirt would work just as well!</li>

        </div>
        <li>7 onsies -- dependent on if you have a washer and dryer, having at least one for each day incase messes helps a lot, and 7 more onsies in the next size (mix of short and long sleeved) incase you have a big baby like we did!</li>

        </div>
        <li>Baby socks -- Of course how many you need depends on the climate of where you live or the time of year you're expecting. Our son was born in spring, but the apartment was always chilly so we wanted to be sure to keep him extra warm! We only got a 4 pack, however this pack here is very cheap and rated highly so I figured it's worth recommending!</li>

        <li>Diapers -- I would suggest 1 pack of newborn and 1 pack of size 1 diapers. You could stock up BUT you don’t know how quickly your little one will move up to the next size! So I'd take on buying anymore diapers as you need them. And while we're on the topic if you aren't familiar with diaper brands yet you will be soon, for instance huggies is the most expensive brand you'll see but that's because they really are the best in my experience. They're very soft and are the least likely to leak. Still, we hardly bought them because you can get parent's choice for significantly less. In the earlier weeks or months when our baby is tiniest is when they are the most prone to blowouts (poop everywhere) this is the time if any that I would suggest spending a little bit more on diapers, later in the future it's easier to prevent blow outs as diapers fit better and poop are less frequent.</li>

        <li>Wipes -- You literally can’t buy too many of these, you’ll be using wipes for at least the next 1-2 years, so if you can feel free to stock up on these.</li>

        <li>Breast pump -- This is not necessary for everyone, but it's nice if you want time away or you have an over supply. You can usually get one free with your insurance.</li>

        <li>1-3 bottles -- Even if you don't plan on using formula or a breast pump, having at least 1 bottle for emergencies is good. Not to forget if you're exclusively breast feeding your nipples may get too sore at some points to nurse, eventually you get used to it and can handle it better but the first few months can hurt a lot, and giving yourself a chance to give them a break is really nice.</li>

        <li>2-4 pacifiers -- The hospital gave us our first pacifier, and he loved it. It was shaped just like these, I quickly tried to ween him off because I didn't know if him using them would have negative affect. I personally deeply regret that because now I can't get him to use them again and he often wants to nurse for comfort/to soothe himself. To me I'd much rather he use the pacifiers at this point because I'm working on weening him off breastfeeding!</li>

        <li>A swing or rocker -- This isn’t necessary, but if possible get one, it buys you some free time for your sanity. You can even often buy them very lightly used for less than half the price online.</li>

        <li>Easy to eat snacks or meals for yourself -- If possible try snacks you can access quietly, for instance opening a bag of chips might just change your snack time back to baby time if he/she wakes up. Protein shakes, snacking on pre-bagged strawberries, cherry tomatoes, meat and cheese bites, etc. Having quick easy to access food is really nice in the early weeks as your adjusting to living on baby’s time. Note: the product above is not something I've never tried because I luckily had no issues with my supply, however I have heard great things about it on Instagram!</li></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%">I listed about the minimum number of items one would need, of course if you can get a little more of these items that would be great, but this is about what we had and our baby was and still is fine! We were super lucky to have loving people in our lives that gave us many of these things at the baby shower, but if you don’t plan on having one you can easily get a lot of these items on facebook marketplace, letgo, offerup, etc, or there are usually government or church programs that offer help! My husband and I aren't Christain but we found a wonderful church that offered help to everyone, everytime we attended an educational class for pregnancy/parenting we'd recieve a "Diaper Buck" each one is worth 10 diapers or 10 diaper bucks would get us a new carseat! You never know what your community offers so check it out! I really hope this helped any new mothers with no idea of what to expect or how they’d go about buying everything they need!
